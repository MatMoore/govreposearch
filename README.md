# Gov Repo Search

GovRepoSearch is a web app that lets you search for public sector open source
software on Github.

## How it works

The crawler queries all code repositories belonging to known government
organisations on Github, using the Github API.

The README text and other repository information get added to an Elasticsearch
search index.

To be indexed, a repository has to have a README file, and licence information.
If there isn't a LICENCE.txt/md/rst file, the crawler tries to guess from the
readme (not all licences are recognised this way).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run the development environment.

Then, enter the ubuntu virtual machine:
```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
```

Alternatively, you can install [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) 2.4.0 directly on your
host machine.

### Install dependencies

Install the gem dependencies with:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

### Building the search index

To use the app you need to create and populate the search index.

First, create the index:
```
bundle exec rake index:create_or_replace
```

If you get any errors, check that Elasticsearch is running and listening on port
9200.

You can check Elasticsearch's health by visiting [http://localhost:9200/_cat/health]().

After creating the index, run the crawler with:
```
bundle exec rake crawler:crawl
```

P.S. the crawler will crash when it hits the Github API's rate limit of 60
requests/hour... ðŸ˜±

To crawl the whole list of organisations, you need an access token.
Visit [https://github.com/settings/tokens]() to generate one.

Then set the environment variable `GITHUB_API_KEY`, or add it to a `.env` file
in the root of the project, like
```
GITHUB_API_KEY=<your key here>
```

Indexing takes a while to run.

### Running the app

Run the app in development with
```
foreman start
```

If everything is working you should be able to view the app in your browser
at http://localhost:3000

## Running the tests

The tests are all written in RSpec.

Run them using:
```
bundle exec rspec
```

## Deployment

### Using ansible
In the `ansible` directory, create a file named `hosts` with the ip/hostname of the server:

```ini
[default]
some.server.here
```

In the same directory, create a secrets file
`ansible-vault edit secrets.yml`

In this file, set a secret key:

```
---
secret_key_base: somesecretkeyhere
```

Then run:

- `ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass -s -i hosts playbook.yml` to set up elasticsearch and nginx
- `ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass -s -i hosts deploy.yml` to deploy the app

These playbooks don't run the crawler. This can either be run manually or scheduled to run nightly, using the rake task.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

### Data that might be useful
The github API gives a lot of information about repositories, including:

- README text
- Number of commits
- Most recent commit
- Repository topics
- Programming languages used
- Number of people that have starred or forked the repository
- Tags that follow semantic versioning
- Size of codebase

Some organisations also follow metadata standards, which could tell us more
about their repositories. For example:
- [civic.json](http://open.dc.gov/civic.json/)
- [.about.yml](https://github.com/18F/about_yml)
- [.codeinventory.yml](https://github.com/GSA/codeinventory)
